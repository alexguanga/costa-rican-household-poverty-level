    "Title: Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "- *About*: Many social programs have a hard time making sure the right people are given enough aid. It’s especially tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. The world’s poorest typically can’t provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify.*\n",
    "- *In Latin America, one popular method uses an algorithm to verify income qualification. It’s called the Proxy Means Test (or PMT). With PMT, agencies use a model that considers a family’s observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling, or the assets found in the home to classify them and predict their level of need.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring Metric: Accuracy\n",
    "- Accuracy is one metric for evaluating classification models. Informally, accuracy is the fraction of predictions our model got right. Formally, accuracy has the following definition:\n",
    "- Formula: $(TP + TN)/(TP + FP + TN + FN)$\n",
    "    - TP: True Positives\n",
    "    - FP: False Positives\n",
    "    - TN: True Negatives\n",
    "    - FN: False Negatives"

    "## Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's important to understand `dtypes`, this can cause some models to work or not work as efficient.\n",
    "2. Creating a color dictionary for target value will keep the value consistent throughout the data.\n",
    "3. `groupby` is becoming one of the most important features in pandas. It helps structure the data for analysis and visualizations.\n",
    "4. Missing values can be tricky. Missing values in one feature could actually be represented in another feature.\n",
    "5. Function: `get_categorical_percent()`\n",
    "    - Useful function to understand the distribution of the target variable.\n",
    "    - Location of code: \"/Users/alexguanga/All_Projects/ds-portfolio/DataScience_Framework/DataScience_Code/categorical_percent.py\"\n",
    "6. `feature importance` is a useful library to understand the influence of variables on the models!\n",
    "7. `cumulative feature importance` can also shed light on how many feature are needed!\n",
    "8. It's good practice to plot the score results, it can help us visualize if we are improving our models\n",
    "9. `Recursive Feature Elimination` can help us select the important features\n",
    "10. This should be further explored but `macro_f1` score was used to improve the model.\n",
    "    - F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)\n",
    "    - Precision = tp/(tp+fp)\n",
    "        - The relation between true positives and the total of true positives and false positives.\n",
    "        - Accuracy of the predictions (percentage). If we train a model, we can classify as a sunny day as a positive. True positives will be the times our model correctly predicted sunny day. False positives will be the times our model incorrectly predicted rain. In both occasions, we predicted rain but we only care about the ratio we got it correct.\n",
    "    - Recall = tp/(tp+fn)\n",
    "        - The relation between true positives to the total number of true positives and false negatives.\n",
    "        - Recall looks at the actual ground truths. If we train a model. we can classify a sunny day as a positive. True positives will be the times our model correctly predicted sunny day. False negative will be days where we predicted rainy BUT were actually sunny. Thus, recall could be viewed as the ratio of correct predictions to the times we should have predicted.\n",
    "11. The library `hyperopt` can help us narrow down the space we perform our modeling. Hence, computation could sed up. We do not have to waste time testing our model through the wrong \"search space\"\n",
    "12. Another **good practice** is to save the training models to `pickles` or a csv file.\n",
    "13. The `get_corrs_matrix` offers a great method to find the inter-correlation among features!\n",
    "    - PATH = \"/Users/alexguanga/All_Projects/ds-portfolio/DataScience_Framework/DataScience_Code/get_corrs_matrix.py\"\n",
    "14. `argmax` is a useful np.function. For example, if we have boolean variables that are mutually inclusive **where order matters**, we can use argmax to return the index of its position based on how the features are calculated.\n",
    "15. If we encounter `SettingWithCopyWarning`, we can use:\n",
    "    - `pd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None  # default='warn'`, to disable to error\n",
    "16. When using `lambda` functions, one neat trick is to assign a name to the lambda function. \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Creating the range functions\n",
    "    range_ = lambda x: x.max() - x.min()\n",
    "    range_.__name__ = 'range_'\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Group and aggregate\n",
    "    ind_agg = ind.drop(['Target'], axis=1).groupby('idhogar').agg(['count', 'std', range_])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "17. The `pipeline` function is a great way to produce data manipulation with less coding.\n",
    "    - For example, we can use `imputer` and `scalar` in the pipeline.\n",
    "        - `imputer`: How to handle missing values.\n",
    "        - `scalar`: How to standarized the data."
